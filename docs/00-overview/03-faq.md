# ❓ NAP 9 — Frequently Asked Questions

A concise, high-signal FAQ covering the most common questions players, R5s, and Clerks will ask when interacting with NAP 9.

---

# 🧱 General Questions

## **What *is* NAP 9?**
NAP 9 is a procedural governance system for Server 1866.  
It defines **membership tiers**, **case handling**, **voting**, **penalties**, and **land rules** using a formal judicial + legislative structure.

It replaces loosely enforced diplomacy with a consistent, trackable, auditable system.

---

## **Why is it called NAP 9?**
Because it is governed by **9 Full Member alliances**, each with one voting representative.  
This is the minimum size needed for:

- resilience  
- quorum  
- distribution of responsibility  
- multi-timezone consistency  

---

## **Is this the same as the old NAP 15?**
No. NAP 9 is smaller, structured, procedural, and functional.  
NAP 15 was attendance-optional and often inactive.  
NAP 9 requires engagement and has real consequences for silence.

---

# 👥 Membership

## **Who can be a Full Member?**
The **Top 9 alliances** in weekly power ranking.

## **How does an alliance become an Associate Member?**
First-come, first-served:

1. R5 posts a petition in `#membership-petitions`  
2. Verified by a Clerk  
3. Added to Associate list if slots are available (max 7)

---

## **Do Associate Members have protection?**
Yes — they receive **L1–L5 NAP protection**.  
They do *not* receive:

- L6 rights  
- voting rights  
- rotation participation  

---

## **What happens if an alliance opts out of NAP 9?**
They immediately lose:

- all land protections  
- standing in disputes  
- evidence submission rights  
- L6 ownership  

NAP 9 does **not** protect independent alliances.

---

# 🗳️ Voting & Process

## **How long do votes last?**
- **24h** — amendments, blacklists, expulsions, appeals  
- **16h** — normal rulings, moderate cases  
- **8h** — emergencies, active attacks  

If all 9 reps vote early → vote closes instantly.

---

## **What counts as quorum?**
- **5 of 9** votes (YES, NO, or ABSTAIN)

Absence does **not** count.

---

## **What’s the difference between Simple Majority and Supermajority?**
- **Simple Majority (5 YES)** → standard penalties  
- **Supermajority (7 YES)** → blacklists, amendments, expulsions  

---

## **Does ABSTAIN count as a vote?**
Yes — it counts toward quorum.

---

# ⚖️ Offenses & Penalties

## **What are the offense tiers?**
- 🟨 **Minor** — accidental, low impact  
- 🟧 **Moderate** — repeated or harmful  
- 🟥 **Severe** — major or malicious  

---

## **What causes escalation?**
- 2 Minors in 14 days → Moderate  
- 2 Moderates in 30 days → Severe  
- Evidence tampering → automatic Severe  
- Penalty evasion → automatic Severe  

---

## **What is an automatic blacklist?**
Only one behavior triggers automatic blacklisting:

### **Dropping tags to attack another player (Rule 6).**

- First instance → 48h ban  
- Second instance → **automatic permanent blacklist**  

Everything else requires a Council vote.

---

# 🛠️ Case Handling

## **What do I do if something happens in-game?**
1. Take screenshots (with timestamps)  
2. Write a short summary  
3. Post in `#evidence`  
4. Wait for Clerk approval  

Do *not* DM Clerks unless asked.

---

## **What evidence is required?**
- timestamped screenshot/video  
- offender clearly visible  
- clear and direct view of event  
- context only if needed  

No collages.  
No edited screenshots.  
No DM logs.

---

## **When does the Council officially “receive” a case?**
When a Clerk:

- verifies the evidence  
- assigns a Case ID  
- posts it in `#case-log`  

Until then, no voting or penalties can begin.

---

# 🗺️ Land & Rotation

## **Who can hold L6 lands?**
Only:
- **Top 3 Full Member alliances**  
- following weekly rotation  

---

## **Can Associate Members or Non-Members hold L6?**
No.

Associate Members must release L6 immediately.  
Non-Members may be forcibly stripped of L6 without penalty.

---

## **What if an alliance refuses a temporary drop?**
They lose **L6 eligibility** for the full rotation cycle.

---

# 🚫 Blacklisting & Harboring

## **What counts as harboring?**
Allowing a banned or blacklisted player to:

- remain in your alliance  
- participate in operations  
- avoid penalties  

Harboring results in:

- immediate loss of protection  
- immediate loss of rotation rights  
- potential Severe case  

---

## **Can blacklisted players ever return?**
Yes — **only** via a 7/9 Supermajority vote.

Automatic blacklists (tag-drop) still require Supermajority to overturn.

---

# 🚑 Appeals

## **What penalties can be appealed?**
Only penalties lasting **more than 48 hours**.

## **How long do I have to file an appeal?**
Within **48 hours** of the penalty.

## **How does an appeal work?**
1. Post in `#appeals`  
2. Clerk validates  
3. 24h Review  
4. 24h Vote  

Results:
- **5 YES** → reduced  
- **7 YES** → overturned  
- anything else → denied  

---

# 📉 Participation / Inactivity

## **What happens if a Council seat goes silent?**
If a Full Member:

- misses **2 emergency votes** → review  
- misses **3 votes total within 14 days** → disciplinary review  

Penalties may include:

- rotation suspension  
- downgrade to Associate  
- loss of voting rights  

---

## **Can an alliance lose Full Member status?**
Yes, if:

- they drop out of the Top 9  
- are expelled by Supermajority  
- fail participation requirements  

The next alliance in power ranking moves into the open seat.

---
