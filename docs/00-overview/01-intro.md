# 🛡️ Welcome to **NAP 9**

### The Governance Engine of Server 1866

NAP 9 is a response to the litany of issues presented by NAP 15's failures. 

This NAP establishes a clear, structured, and dependable framework for diplomacy, conflict resolution, and alliance cooperation.

It moves Server 1866 away from improvised reactions and toward a predictable, accountable, and sustainable system.

NAP 9 is not a passive pact, it is an institution with Clerks, Delegates, defined procedures, and real expectations for participation.

If your alliance seeks stability, fairness, and reliable governance, this system was created as a love letter to you.

## ⭐ What Makes NAP 9 Strong

### **🗂️ Clerkship System, the Backbone of Fair Process**
NAP 9 introduces **neutral Clerks** who ensure all cases follow the same path:

- verifying evidence  
- opening and closing vote windows  
- maintaining archives  
- ensuring procedural correctness  

You should not have be an expert in Discord operations to be an R5 of an alliance in Last War.

This feature removes the headache of administrative burden from busy alliance leadership and keeps the judicial process consistent, fair, and transparent.

---

### **👥 Delegate Structure, Flexible Representation**
Every Full Member alliance appoints:

- one voting representative  
- one alternate delegate  

This guarantees:
- no silent seats  
- progress even when leaders are busy  
- shared accountability  
- stable, continuous involvement in Council operations  

NAP 15 required every R5 to be present for all matters of activity, but that isn't realistic to how alliance leadership is structured. This system gives relief through much needed flexibility.

---

### **🔢 Quorum & Voting System**
A Quorum is the minimum number of Council members that must be present to conduct Council activities, such as voting.

NAP 9 uses a asynchronous quorum model so Council activity continues across timezones and schedules.

- **Quorum:** 5 of 9  
- **Simple Majority:** 5 YES  
- **Supermajority:** 7 YES  
- **Vote Windows:** 24h / 16h / 8h  
- **Abstain:** counts toward quorum  
- **Full participation:** closes votes early  
  
The system fixes MANY problems caused by NAP 15 which made voting feel pointless and inaccessible.

---

### **⚖️ Disciplinary Framework for Clear, Predictable Outcomes**
Incidents are categorized:

- **Minor** — low-impact, accidental  
- **Moderate** — repeated or harmful  
- **Severe** — high-impact or malicious  
- **Tag-Drop** — automatic escalation to blacklist rules  

Each tier uses standardized penalties and escalation.  

No guesswork. No improvisation. No politics.

## 🎯 What NAP 9 Is Designed To Provide

NAP 9 expects:

- active diplomacy  
- timely votes  
- awareness of ongoing cases  
- responsibility in representation  
- engagement from participating alliances  

In return, it delivers:

- stable land governance  
- consistent treatment of all alliances  
- reliable conflict handling  
- strong protections for compliant members  
- meaningful structure for server-wide cooperation  

Alliances who contribute to stability receive full benefits.  s

Alliances who disengage lose privileges by design. Alliances who have been long unresponsive to diplomatic conversations can no longer remain silent AND benefit from the NAP.

---

## 🌐 Who Benefits From NAP 9?

NAP 9 is built for alliances that value:

- fairness  
- predictability  
- clarity  
- structured communication  
- consistent protection under shared rules  

If your alliance wants reliable diplomacy and equal treatment, this system supports that.
